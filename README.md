## Installation

Miniconda/Anaconda manager installation is highly recommended before the course. 

Please, download an installation file (environment.yml) from this repo. 
It is recommended to create a new folder (e.g. "BDS3_2025" for it). 

```bash
  cd ./your_path/BDS3_2025
  conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To activate the environment: 

```bash
conda activate bioimage_env 
```

To deactivate the environment: 

```bash
deactivate #from an active environment  
```

To open Jupyter Lab: 

```bash
jupyter lab
```
